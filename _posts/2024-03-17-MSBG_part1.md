This post is an exploration of applying simple maths to simulate outcomes of a tabletop wargame. The game in question used here is [Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game](https://middle-earthstrategybattlegame.com/) (MESBG). Set in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit the game uses a set of rules to determine movement, combat, and magic use. Players take turns issuing commands to their miniatures, maneuvering them around a battlefield constructed with terrain pieces. Six-sided dice are rolled to resolve actions, adding a chance element to the battles.

The notions here are described in [this blog from TMAT](https://tellmeatalegreatorsmall.blogspot.com/2021/03/math-am-i-gonna-win-this-duel.html) dedicated to the game and its hobby. The original posts develop the simulators in Excel, which I try here translate into R. 

In MESBG, combat is works in two phases:
*The dueling phase to determine who has a chance of doing wounds
*The wounding phase to determine if and how many wounds have been given to the losing side of the duel

# Dueling phase
## Dice result generator

In MESBG, an 'even duel' refers to a combat scenario where both participating models possess identical statistics relevant to close-quarters combat. In such an instance, both combatants would share the same attack (duel) value and fight value. Consequently, the victor is solely determined by the outcome of a die roll, with the higher roll securing victory. Conversely, the lower roll results in defeat, and a tie necessitates a subsequent die roll to break the deadlock. Essentially, this encounter represents a symmetrical confrontation,  where both participants possess statistically equivalent probabilities of success."

Here we will translate this into a dice outcome matrix

```r
outcome_matrix <- matrix(c(
  "T", "E", "E", "E", "E", "E",
  "G", "T", "E", "E", "E", "E",
  "G", "G", "T", "E", "E", "E",
  "G", "G", "G", "T", "E", "E",
  "G", "G", "G", "G", "T", "E",
  "G", "G", "G", "G", "G", "T"
), nrow = 6, byrow = TRUE)
```
The horizontal line represents the rolls from team **E**vil and and the vertical line the rolls from team **G**ood. We see that whenever both rolls match, it is a **T**ie.

## Calculating high dice value probabilties

In the game, odds are each side will be rolling more than one dice. We can calculate the probability of a a six-sided dice value being the highest value of a roll where multiple dices are thrown. 

To quote TMAT:
>We know that there are 6 discrete probabilities when we roll 1 die, 36 discrete probabilities when we roll 2 dice, 216 discrete probabilities when we roll 3 dice, etc. How do we get these numbers? The answer is exponents: 6^1 (or 6) is 6,  6^2 (or 6x6) is 36, 6^3 (or 6x6x6) is 216 [...]

How would we do this in R? 

```r 
prob_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = 6, ncol = 6) #Define a matrix with 6 rows and 6 columns, initialy filled with zeroes
for (highest in 1:6) { #Loop through all possible values from 1 to 6 that represent the *highest* value on the roll
  for (dice in 1:6) { #Inner loop that iterates for all possible values
    if (highest == 1) { #Calculates the probability of dice when the highest value is '1'
      prob_matrix[highest, dice] <- (1/6)^dice #Since there are 6 faces on the die, chance of success for each roll is 1/6
    } else { #Calculates probability when roll value is greater than 1 (all other iterations)
      prob_matrix[highest, dice] <- (highest/6)^dice - ((highest - 1)/6)^dice #The first term, (highest/6)^dice, represents the probability of successfully rolling all sides up to `dice`. The second term, ((highest - 1)/6)^dice, represents the probability of successfully rolling all sides strictly less than `dice` (i.e., failing to roll the highest value). Subtracting the second term from the first term gives us the probability of NOT rolling anything higher than dice, which is the complement of what we actually want (probability of rolling exactly `dice`).
    }
  }
}
```

## Integrating model units stats 
In MESBG, unit stats are represented by a collection of values that define a unit's capabilities in combat, movement, and resilience. The following are those relevant for combat.

```r
Team_Good <- list(DuelingDice = 4, FightValue = 7, WoundingAttacks = 4, WoundingDifficulty = 3)
Team_Evil <- list(DuelingDice = 6, FightValue = 4, WoundingAttacks = 6, WoundingDifficulty = 5)
```

As we can see both side do not have equal values. Team Evil will roll 6 dices to team Good's 4 dices, but Team Good has a higher fight value, meaning that it wins ties when they both get same high value dice rolls.

## Calculating probabilities of each side getting the high rolls

Using the `DuelingDice`value, we calculate the probabilities of each side getting the highest roll.

```r
# Calculate probabilities for Team Good and Team Bad getting high values of 1 to 6
team_good_high_roll_probs <- prob_matrix[, Team_Good$DuelingDice]
team_evil_high_roll_probs <- prob_matrix[, Team_Evil$DuelingDice]

# Initialize probabilities for outcomes
prob_G <- 0
prob_E <- 0
prob_T <- 0

# Calculate the probabilities for each outcome
for (i in 1:6) {
  for (j in 1:6) {
    outcome <- outcome_matrix[i, j]
    prob_outcome <- team_good_high_roll_probs[i] * team_evil_high_roll_probs[j]
    
    if (outcome == "G") {
      prob_G <- prob_G + prob_outcome
    } else if (outcome == "E") {
      prob_E <- prob_E + prob_outcome
    } else if (outcome == "T") {
      prob_T <- prob_T + prob_outcome
    }
  }
}

```
Lets output the probabilities in an easy to read bar chart, using the `ggplot2` package.

```r
library(ggplot2)
# Example data frame for visualization
data <- data.frame(
  Outcome = c("G", "E", "T"),
  Probability = c(prob_G, prob_E, prob_T) * 100
# The graph
ggplot(data, aes(x = Outcome, y = Probability, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Outcome Probabilities", x = "Outcome", y = "Probability (%)")+
 geom_text(aes(label = round(Probability,2)), vjust = -0.5, size = 4) 
```

As we can see ties are the most probable outcomes (both side rolling the highest value dice). The side with the highest `FightValue` wins ties. Let's add this to our calculations with a simple `IF` statement.

```r
# Allocate tie probabilities to Team Good due to higher Fight Value
if (Team_Good$FightValue > Team_Evil$FightValue) {
  prob_G <- prob_G + prob_T
} else {
  prob_B <- prob_E + prob_T
}

# Calculate total win probabilities
total_win_prob_Good <- prob_G
total_win_prob_Evil <- prob_E

# Output the probabilities
cat("Total win probability for Team Good:", sprintf("%.2f%%", total_win_prob_Good * 100), "\n")
cat("Total win probability for Team Evil:", sprintf("%.2f%%", total_win_prob_Evil * 100), "\n")
```

Let us put it in a graph again for easier comparison.

```r
data <- data.frame(
  Outcome = c("G", "E"),
  Probability = c(total_win_prob_Good, total_win_prob_Evil) * 100
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Probability, y = Outcome, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.4)+
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Outcome Probabilities", x = "Probability (%)", y = "Outcome") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Probability, 2)), hjust = -0.1, size = 4) 
```
